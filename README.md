## Archival Information
To my fellow group project classmates that may or may not see this, I am marking this as archival. If you want access to this, please feel free to contact me directly or open an issue. Also, feel free to reach out, you folks were a highlight of that school year. The reason that I am marking this for archive is that security issues relating to the npm plugins have managed to show up from time to time.
